Sammie-Roto is designed to be a user-friendly tool for AI assisted masking of video clips. It serves as a free alternative to commercial solutions such as Adobe’s Roto Brush or DaVinci Resolve's Magic Mask. It is generally less accurate than manual rotoscoping, but can usually give a pretty good result with little effort.
